    <h1>All Loop Example</h1>
    <p>


        Sure, I'll explain each loop type in a basic way:

While Loop:
Syntax:
javascript
Copy code
while (condition) {
    // code block to be executed
}
Explanation:
It keeps executing a block of code as long as the specified condition is true.
The condition is evaluated before executing the code block, so if the condition is false initially, the code inside the loop will never run.




Do-While Loop:
Syntax:
javascript
Copy code
do {
    // code block to be executed
} while (condition);
Explanation:
It is similar to the while loop, but the code block is executed at least once before the condition is tested.
After the first execution, the condition is checked, and if it's true, the loop will continue to execute. If false, the loop stops.


For Loop:
Syntax:
javascript
Copy code
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // code block to be executed
}
Explanation:
It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.
The initialization is executed before the loop starts. The condition is checked before each iteration, and if true, the code block runs. After each iteration, the increment/decrement statement is executed.
It's often used when the number of iterations is known or when looping through arrays.
